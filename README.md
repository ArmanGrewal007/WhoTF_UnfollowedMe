## Basic working

We have a single script: `instagram_unfollowed_checker` using which you can see whotf unfollowed you recently. Requirements:

* A valid instagram *username* and *password*. (I would suggest creating a bot account, [here](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/emailsignup/))
* target username, whose unfollowers you want to check

## Local setup

* Fork/Clone this repo to your local machine
* Make sure you have Python 3.5+ installed in your system
* Install necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Change the variables in `instagram_unfollowed_checker` script with your own
* Run the script. 
* I had about 400 followers and it took 1 minute to run. So, I would suggest add a debugger at the end for easier usage!
